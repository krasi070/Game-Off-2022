<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Turn-based strategy game where you don't get to pick the actions you take but have to make do with what the hero provides you with. He can be quite stubborn so you only have a few suggestions to give him before his ego gets hurt which makes him more vulnerable to attacks. But if you leave his perfect plan untouched (as in encouraging it), his ego will get boosted which has its own benefits.
